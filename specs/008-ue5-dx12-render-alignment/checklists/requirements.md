# Specification Quality Checklist: UE5-Style DX12 Render Alignment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-04-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Scope is intentionally limited to a DX12-only active runtime path in phase 1 while preserving future multi-backend architecture boundaries.
- The feature is aligned to UE 5.7 public rendering contracts first and explicitly requires a documented UE source audit before full closure claims.
- "No fallback" is treated as a hard architectural requirement, not a temporary preference.
