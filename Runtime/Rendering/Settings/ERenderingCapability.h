		DITHER,						// Dither color components or indices before they are written to the color buffer.
		POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL,		// An offset is added to depth values of a polygon's fragments produced by rasterization.
		SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE,	// Compute a temporary coverage value where each bit is determined by the alpha value at the corresponding sample location. The temporary coverage value is then ANDed with the fragment coverage value.
		SAMPLE_COVERAGE,			// The fragment's coverage is ANDed with the temporary coverage value. If GL_SAMPLE_COVERAGE_INVERT is set to GL_TRUE, invert the coverage value.
		SCISSOR_TEST,				// Discard fragments that are outside the scissor rectangle.
		STENCIL_TEST,				// Do stencil testing and update the stencil buffer.
		MULTISAMPLE					// Use multiple fragment samples in computing the final color of a pixel.
